# Shopping Cart
A fun project that uses Centrecom's image source. Disclaim: I do not intend to compete with Centrecom

## Technologies used:
- HTML5 and JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Achievements:
- Create a home page with images
- Create a store page with Add to Cart function
- Remove item from cart
- Responsive site

## Enhancement:
- Add cart number correctly based on items rather than types of items
- Add animation on hover for images
- Add to cart button needs more responsive
